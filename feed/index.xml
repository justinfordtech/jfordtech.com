<p>The Middle Tennessee tech industry is on fire, and it&#8217;s not hard to see why. With a combination of talent, business support, and a creative culture, this region is quickly becoming a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>



<p>One of the key factors driving the growth of the Middle Tennessee tech industry is the abundance of skilled workers in the area. Universities like Vanderbilt, Tennessee State, and Belmont are producing top-tier graduates in computer science, engineering, and other tech-related fields. These graduates bring fresh perspectives and cutting-edge skills to the local tech scene.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s not just about the people. The business environment in Middle Tennessee is also highly supportive of tech startups and established tech companies. Low taxes, reasonable regulations, and a variety of funding opportunities make it easy for entrepreneurs to get their businesses up and running. Plus, with a growing network of co-working spaces, incubators, and accelerators, there&#8217;s plenty of support available for startups at every stage of development.</p>



<p>The creative culture of Middle Tennessee is another major asset for the tech industry. The region has a thriving music scene, as well as a growing community of artists and makers. This culture of creativity and experimentation spills over into the tech industry, inspiring new ideas and pushing the boundaries of what&#8217;s possible.</p>



<p>Finally, Middle Tennessee&#8217;s location is ideal for connecting with other tech hubs across the country. With major airports in Nashville and nearby cities like Atlanta and Louisville, it&#8217;s easy for entrepreneurs to travel and build relationships with other tech industry players.</p>



<p>All of these factors have combined to create a vibrant and rapidly growing tech industry in Middle Tennessee. Whether you&#8217;re a startup founder, an investor, or just a tech enthusiast, this is an exciting time to be part of the action. So what are you waiting for? Come check out what Middle Tennessee has to offer!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Are you the kind of person who covers their webcam with a piece of tape? Do you refuse to use public Wi-Fi networks for fear of being hacked? Are you convinced that Mark Zuckerberg is personally reading your Facebook messages? If so, you&#8217;re not alone.</p>



<p>Privacy and security are serious topics, but sometimes our fears can get the best of us. Here are some tips for keeping your secrets safe, without going overboard:</p>



<ol>
<li>Use a strong password. Yes, we know you&#8217;ve heard this one before, but seriously, it&#8217;s important. And no, &#8220;password123&#8221; doesn&#8217;t count.</li>



<li>Keep your software up to date. Those annoying update notifications are actually there for a reason. Software updates often include security patches that can fix vulnerabilities and protect you from attacks.</li>



<li>Be careful what you click on. That &#8220;free iPhone giveaway&#8221; probably isn&#8217;t real, and that &#8220;urgent message from your bank&#8221; is likely a phishing scam. When in doubt, don&#8217;t click.</li>



<li>Use a VPN (if you really want to). Virtual private networks can help protect your online activity from prying eyes, but they&#8217;re not foolproof. And let&#8217;s be real, unless you&#8217;re a spy or a supervillain, you probably don&#8217;t need one.</li>



<li>Don&#8217;t be too paranoid. Yes, there are hackers out there. Yes, your data is probably being collected by various companies. But unless you&#8217;re doing something truly nefarious, the chances of someone actually coming after you are pretty slim.</li>
</ol>



<p>Yes, privacy and security are important. But don&#8217;t let your fears get the best of you. Take reasonable precautions, but don&#8217;t forget to live your life. Call me (Justin) at <a href="tel:239-391-4295">239-391-4295</a> for help with all your privacy and security needs.<br><br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There are so many tips, tricks and life-hacks when it comes to using your computer that it is impossible to memorize them all! Here are five that make my life easier on a daily basis and hopefully help you, too!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Taking A Screenshot</h2>



<p>There are lots of programs out there that one can use to take a picture of the screen. This method involves opening a program, dragging an area to capture and choosing the location to save it to. Did you know there is a button right on you keyboard that does it in one click? The &#8220;Print Screen&#8221; key actually has a use! Just tap it!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Undo</h2>



<p>Almost every computer program, web browser and even OS (Windows, MAC and Linux) agree that ctrl + z is used to undo that last action. Sometimes will editing a photo, writing up a large document, etc. I will make a huge mistake like deleting an entire page in one click. Panic sets in, and then I remember holding down the ctrl key and pressing z will save the day. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="420" height="294" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ctlrzLife.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-42" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ctlrzLife.jpg 420w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ctlrzLife-300x210.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Window Snapping</h2>



<p>One of the features being introduced recently in Windows 11 is snapping windows to the top, bottom, left and right of the screen. This has been around for over a decade on Linux operating systems known as Tiling Windows. Just grab the tab or window and drag it where you want and it should snap automatically.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Night Mode</h2>



<p>Staring at a screen on a dark room can cause serious eye strain and migraines. A feature that come out recently is Night Mode. Basically, it dims the blue light and reduces the discomfort.  Windows, MAC, Linux have this feature and even most phones. If your phone lacks this option, don&#8217;t worry, there are plenty of apps that will take care of it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Limiting Startup Programs</h2>



<p>Some computers seem to take forever to boot up after being turned on or after a restart! This is usually caused by many unnecessary programs starting when when the computer starts. Some good examples are Zoom, iTunes Helper, Adobe Reader and Microsoft Office. Most times we just want to open a browser to check the emails, watch some YouTube or check Facebook. We don&#8217;t need all these other apps slowing down the startup and slowing down the computer in general while they run in the background.</p>



<p>On Windows open the Task Manager, click the Startup tab and disable everything you don&#8217;t need.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="626" height="369" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/winStrtup.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-43" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/winStrtup.jpg 626w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/winStrtup-300x177.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /></figure>



<p>On your Mac, choose Apple menu &gt; System Settings, click General in the sidebar, then click Login Items on the right. Remove what&#8217;s not needed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/macStrtup.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44" width="623" height="424" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/macStrtup.png 753w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/macStrtup-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /></figure>



<p>Hopefully these tops save you some time and frustration. </p>
